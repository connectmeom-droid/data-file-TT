<div><u>Bachelor of Architecture(B.ARCH)</u><br>
<div>__<font size="2">Initiated in July 2008, the Department of Architecture at the School of Planning and Architecture, Bhopal, fosters a vibrant design culture. Our program ensures that graduates are not only well-regarded in architectural practice but are also equipped to make critical contributions to the profession's future. We emphasize an open studio culture where students across all levels can collaborate, learn from each other, and develop innovative ideas. This environment encourages independent and original research, providing in-depth practical knowledge.</font>
<p></p>
__<font size="2">Our curriculum is comprehensive, covering both the theoretical and practical aspects of architecture and planning. We focus on understanding the broader and deeper aspects of human interaction with physical and cultural contexts. Our students are trained to think innovatively and critically, understanding their role in society and how it integrates with others to create well-designed, safe, and sustainable environments.</font>
<p></p>
__<font size="2">The Bachelor of Architecture course integrates studio-based design projects with theoretical knowledge and skills developed through lectures in technical studies and cultural contexts. Extensive practical knowledge is imparted through site visits and case studies. Design projects, requiring both manual and computer-generated presentation skills, are taught in small groups, allowing for personalized attention throughout the course. This work culminates in a comprehensive design portfolio, showcasing students' achievements and preparing them for postgraduate studies or professional careers.</font>

<br>
The Institute has a Training and placement Cell which assists students in selecting suitable organizations for undertaking professional training and facilitates the placement of graduating students.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
The Training and Placement Cell publishes a Placement Brochure providing the profile of all graduating students of B.Plan, B.Arch, M.Arch (Urban Design, Landscape Architecture and Conservation) and M.Plan (Environmental Planning and Urban and Regional Planning) helps in disseminating this data base to professionals and the industry at large. Graduating students have been selected by several reputed firms and consultants both in Campus interviews and off campus. With students of the earlier batches already placed in reputed organizations, the industry-academia links are being rapidly strengthened with the acceptance of our growing numbers of alumni in the professional fraternity.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
The Training and Placement Cell also coordinates the Professional Training of students of all the programmes, which are part of their course curriculum. A Training Manual is designed by the Cell for compliance by students of all courses to streamline a system of evaluating deliverables worked upon in an industrial setup outside the curriculum. Students have been training in reputed National and International organizations both in the government and private sector and across a wide range of organizations including consultants, developers, research organizations and NGOs.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
Human Resource development is a key objective of the institute and the Training and placement Cell strives to meet the demands of the Architectural and Planning professions by facilitating a vibrant industry-academia interface. Workshops for skill upgradation in verbal communication are conducted from time to time to help students.</p>
