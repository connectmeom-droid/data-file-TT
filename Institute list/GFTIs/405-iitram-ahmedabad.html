<br>
<span>CDC plays a pivotal role in grooming students for the workforce through a structured ecosystem that includes technical training, soft skills development, industry exposure, internships, and placement support. At the same time, it provides a seamless and customized recruitment experience for organizations seeking capable, motivated, and well-prepared graduates.</span><br>
