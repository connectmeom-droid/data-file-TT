                    </h4>
                    <span class="fs-7">
                        <p>Gurukula Kangri Vishwavidyalaya was founded on March 4, 1902 by Swami Shraddhanandji with the sole aim to revive the ancient Indian Gurukula System of education, on the bank of holy Ganges at a distance of about 6 km. from Haridwar and about 200 km from Delhi. This institution was established with the objective of providing an indigenous alternative to Lord Macaulay’s education policy by imparting education in the areas of Vedic literature, Indian philosophy, Indian culture, modern sciences and research. It is a deemed to be university fully funded by UGC/Govt. of India.</p>
<p><span>Vishwavidyalaya is accredited by&nbsp;</span><span>National Accreditation and Assessment Council (NAAC) and all B.Tech. programs are AICTE approved.</span></p>
<p>Faculty of Engineering &amp; Technology was established with a view to provide technical education in surroundings of spiritual and Gurukula system of education. Gurukula Kangri Vishwavidyalaya, Haridwar is known in India and abroad for the process of character building of the students through their moral and physical development. Keeping the same ideals in mind, management of the Vishwavidyalaya felt the need of technocrats with strong moral character, superior knowledge, who can serve the nation during this era of transition from materialism to a balance of materialism and spiritualism. The Faculty of Engineering &amp; Technology was established year 2000, at present it is running B.Tech. in Computer Science &amp; Engineering , Electronics &amp; Communication Engineering, Electrical Engineering and Mechanical Engineering.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Students of faculty of Engineering and Technology also regularly go for higher education in prestigious institutions like ISC Banglore, IIT's and NIT's after scoring higher rank in GATE Examination. In recent year one of our student has got
<b>AIR -1 in GATE-2024</b> and more than 50 students have got very good rank in GATE-2024. This year also a large no of students have got very good rank in Gate examination. Apart from this&nbsp;<span>FET is accredited with IBM, TCS and major companies like Infosys, Adobe, Tech. Mahindra, HCL, Mahindra Satyam, J.K.Technosoft, Infogain, Hero Honda, Panasonic have recruited our students. Beside teaching FET conducts regular extracurricular activities like technical festival, sports etc. Vishwavidyalaya is having very good placement cell which take care of placements of students. Students of Electrical and Mechanical Engineering have&nbsp; record&nbsp;placement this year together with students of Computer Science &amp; Engineering&nbsp; and Electronics &amp; Communication&nbsp; Engineering . Students of FET enjoy the facility of state of art gymnasium situated at university stadium as well as in faculty premises.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>Local chapter of NPTEL and Indian Science Congress functions in Engineering premises and provide a base to enhance the skills of students.</p>
<p><span>Faculty of Engineering &amp; Technology</span>&nbsp;is proud to have students from more than 25 states.<br>
