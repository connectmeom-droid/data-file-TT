<p dir="ltr"><span>B.Tech Curriculum</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>IIIT Sri City, Chittoor was mentored by IIIT Hyderabad in the initial years The curriculum at IIIT Sri City follows a practice-theory-practice approach wherein the students are first introduced to real-world engineering concepts by providing hands-on-training. This is followed by rigorous theory-based courses which are again followed up with hands-on courses with intense real-world projects, requiring intense involvement from each student. The curriculum has been designed keeping in mind the best practices of IIIT Hyderabad, IITs, and leading institutions of higher learning globally. The Institute combines top-class education with pioneering research, whereby undergraduate students are encouraged to participate in different research and technology development projects, starting from the 3rd year.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>IIIT Sri City offers B.Tech degree in three disciplines:</span></p>
<ol>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr"><span>Computer Science and Engineering (CSE)&nbsp;</span></p>

The unique curriculum offered facilitates students in becoming top-notch engineers/entrepreneurs while also equipping them to pursue higher studies and research work. We give ample opportunity to learn both fundamentals of theory as well as its application aspects. The curriculum is designed on the foundation of concepts driven by real-world practices which are duly covered in the first half of the program. The second half is engaging in the sense that it provides avenues for developing special skills and gaining knowledge in various sub-areas, gives a hands-on approach through well-guided project works, and also provides the much-needed flexibility in selecting courses that suit individual students. Besides well-designed core subjects, Mathematics, Science, Humanities, and Skill Building Programs are an integral and interesting part of our distinctive curriculum.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>Unique Honors Programme:</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>This is a purely research-intensive part of the curriculum and the promising students meeting the eligibility criteria are encouraged to opt for the Honors Programme starting from the 5th semester and go on up to 8th semester. This Honors program has a set of defined deliverables like research papers, development of products and services, generation of IPs. Students failing in meeting these defined deliverables will get a plain B.Tech degree in the respective discipline.</span></p>
<p dir="ltr">&nbsp;<span>Unique Component in CSE Programme:</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>Full Stack Development (FSD) track</span><span> focuses on producing graduates with industry ready skills in software development. This industry-focused FSD track consists of three courses delivered in a sequence such that the students learn and demonstrate the latest technologies, tools and libraries used in their job situations. These courses together make them learn all three components- Front end, back end and API/Services and be able to develop end to end applications involving all the components effectively. The track simultaneously focuses on making the student undertake a live project that helps them to implement those technology components learned across three courses. The choices of technologies, tools and libraries shall be based on the current industry needs and profile of the batch of students. Three courses offered in 4 to 6 Semesters under this Full-Stack Development track- Fundamentals of Full Stack Development, Framework Driven Front-End Development and Web Services and Backend Development.&nbsp;</span></p>

<p dir="ltr"><span>Internships and Placements......&nbsp;</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>Summer Internship</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>Students at IIIT Sri City are highly encouraged to seek internships during summer irrespective of which year they are enrolled in the institute.</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>While it may sound quite aspirational that we are encouraging even the UG first-year students to seek internships, we believe that an industry experience (from the first year) will go a long way in helping a student launch a bright career, from our institute. So, we encourage students as soon as they join to even get work-from-home internships. We feel that every single aspect of learning should be implemented rigorously and executed with due diligence. Internships are one such milestone at the IIITS.</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>Of course, our focus is to get the pre-final year students to get summer internships, as there is a good chance that these internships can get converted to Pre-Placement Offers (PPO). Google, Microsoft,Amazon, American Express, Yahoo, Swiggy, ZS Associates, Bosch, Commvault are a few of them where our students are currently indulged in their high-end lead projects.</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>Students are also encouraged to take academic internship opportunities both here in India and abroad. The placement office also brings such opportunities to students so that they can apply for many opportunities.</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>Semester-Long Project:</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>Semester-long project is one of the flagship programs of our institute and we have brought in novel aspects into this program so that it benefits the students. There are at least two ways that students benefit from these projects:</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>Students who aspire for their dream jobs sign-up with companies for the program of a Semester-long project with an opportunity to convert into a full-time position.</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>Often the companies visiting the campus for recruitment also offer students an opportunity to join as interns before the students join in the full-time positions in the same company. So, students have a gradual transition from students to their full-time roles.</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>The students get eight credits for these projects, and we have a rigorous review. The students who had opted for a Semester-long project only will be evaluated twice by the industry mentor and the institute faculty mentor.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>Placements: At the Indian Institute of Information Technology Sri City (IIITS), a structured and systematic effort for placements and training is present with a group of faculty members, staff, and students under the leadership of the Director. IIITS considers the career of its students as one of the most important priorities of the institute and prepares its students starting from the year the student joins the campus. We have been shaping this career building through a rigorous, futuristic curriculum that prepares students for working in startups where new and innovative solutions to problems have been offered.</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>Our previous batches of students have launched their careers in a variety of organizations, especially in emerging technology areas. The companies that visited the campus for recruitment not only hired both the CSE and ECE batch students but the companies were also from varied categories: multinational companies, successful startups, cutting-edge technologies computer science companies, and core ECE companies. Some of our multinational recruiters represented industries ranging across Consulting, E-Commerce, Hi-Tech, Hospitality, and Health Care.</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span></span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>The recently graduated batch of 2025 has secured the <b><u>domestic highest salary of 120 lakhs per annum</u></b>. A selected list of the companies that visited our campus in the past are the following: Amazon, Microsoft, Commvault, Deloitte, MotorQ, Walmart, Ola, National Instruments, Ericsson, IBM, Financial Software Solutions, Larsen and Toubro, Tata Consultancy Services,&nbsp; Flutura, Vehant Technologies, Couture AI, Sigmoid, Truminds, Optum, Hyperverge,&nbsp; Knowledge Lens, Center of Excellence in Wireless Technology, Tiger Analytics, Pega, UKG, Incref, Cognizent, Infosys, Instamart, Vahan, MBIT, Typeface, The Math Comany, FIITJEE, K Fin Tech, Cholamandalam, Factset, Woovly, Nference,Pratilipi, Myntra, Lincode, Increff and others.</span></p>
