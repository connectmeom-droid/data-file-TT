Each BTech program has an ideal mix of foundational theory and core subject, breadth in engineering, mathematics, and sciences; soft skills and humanities; contemporary elective subjects in applied areas, and project-based learning through a series of mini and major projects. Most elective subjects are kept open for any student in any program to take the specialized courses of their choice. The eighth semester has no coursework to enable students to carry out the major project and also pursue a full-semester internship in the industry or in other reputed institutes.</font></span></p>
