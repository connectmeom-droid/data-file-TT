<p><span lang="EN-IN">Name of the Students: Suyash Singh, Sandeep Kumar Das and Purnendu Sinha</span></p>
<p><b><span lang="EN-IN">Brief: </span></b></p>
<p><span lang="EN-IN">Students of Atal Bihari Vajpayee-Indian Institute of Information Technology and Management, Gwalior
<b>Mr. Suyash Singh, Mr. Sandeep Kumar Das and Mr. Purnendu Sinha</b> whohad successfully developed their prototype of electric retro fitment kit from an old and scrapped vehicle at ABV-IIITM, Gwalior campus which was a successful project on their concept note towards electric mobility in India.</span></p>
<p><span lang="EN-IN">Several visitors from European high commission, IIT Delhi, IISc Bangalore, Godrej, JK Tyres, Dr. Kota Harinarayana (Father of Tejas Aircraft), Indian Air force etc. have visited their workshop during the development at ABV-IIITM, Gwalior campus which had been a very huge support in terms of feedback and motivation to the team. Team has also received technical suggestions which they have incorporated in their first prototype and still working over it to make the vehicle better and smarter.
</span></p>
<p><span lang="EN-IN">Institute promoted these students to establish a start-up company after providing hands on experience via
<b>Green Innovation Lab</b> in the institute premises. At the <b>start-up </b>centre of ABV-IIITM, Gwalior under the Guidance of Prof R. Sahu, coordinator of start-up centre, these students have registered a company named as
<b>“Grenovators Motor Work Pvt. Ltd.”</b></span></p>
<p><span lang="EN-IN">After developing an electric retro fitment kit for any conventional vehicles, they have also started with the brand-new design as a new product of electric three-wheeler category which can be fast charged within 15-20 mins. as another domain for expansion. The project name is <b>WIN-WIN</b>. </span></p>
<p><span lang="EN-IN">This retro fitment kit runs the vehicle around 100-120 KM in one full charge with full load capacity of five passengers. Maximum speed captured by team over this old vehicle is around 70- 75 Kmph. Team is working upon to increase the range capacity up to 200-220 KM in one charge. The market price will be very much feasible to their customers which they have already worked upon and still working over it, how to reduce down more by having all Indian suppliers. The conversion time as of now is around two weeks, but they have a target to do the conversion of one vehicle just in
<b>twenty-four</b> hours.</span></p>
<p><span lang="EN-IN">Their market research has shown a very high inclination towards this technology by Vikram tempo (three-wheeler auto rickshaw) owners and drivers in Gwalior city as well as other Cities of India. They have published this research study and business opportunity at an <b>SAE’s international symposium of Intelligent and Connected Vehicles in smart city</b>.</span></p>
<p><span lang="EN-IN">Team is also in touch with Gwalior Smart City to introduce this concept on different routes of Gwalior where these Vikram tempos ply.
<b>There are around 1000 Vikram tempos in Gwalior city to be converted into the electric vehicle</b>.</span></p>
<p><span lang="EN-IN">Gwalior Smart City and city administration have shown a very close interest in this project for which the discussions are going on and it will be India’s first smart city to bring this concept and change the public mobility towards green environment. Team Grenovators have also approached few <b>government organisations like NTPC etc</b>. towards the faster development of EV’s in India and to make them green by supplying electricity via solar plants.</span></p>
<p><span lang="EN-IN">Grenovators Motor Work have submitted a proposal to NTPC Ltd. for installing the charging stations, initially in Gwalior and later to PAN India with Grenovators for which the discussion is going on. It will easily solve the problem of charging infrastructure for all EV’s in the city premises.</span></p>
<p><span lang="EN-IN">Grenovators recently in the first week of July 2017 have also raised a good amount of funding for the new product and retro fitment kit development from two different angel investors. They have also extended their office premises both in Delhi and Ahmadabad along with the manufacturing facility in Mahesana which is 60 Km from Ahmedabad.<span>&nbsp;
</span><b>The first production of WIN-WIN (new product) will take place in Mahesana
</b>and the launch of product will be first in Gwalior being a Gwalior born organisation.</span></p>
<p><span lang="EN-IN">Currently, WIN-WIN has completed it first phase of on road test trials and soon will be homologated atiCAT with six different variants.</span></p>
<p><span lang="EN-IN">Grenovators Motor Work with a vision to have a global coverage of
<b>e-mobility</b> has recently formed a consortium as knowledge and technology partner with
<b>NCC, Swedish Transport Administration and Algret Innovations from Sweden and UK</b> to develop the ERS for India. Which will resolve many of our transport problem for logistics in heavy vehicles as well as passenger vehicle to make the urban transport more eco-friendly and smarter.</span></p>
<span lang="EN-IN">Apart from product development Grenovators Motor Work has also expanded to provide engineering services which has bagged some clients as: Tata Technologies (on-going), Honeywell (on-going), Cummins (On-going), Eaton (on-going), Mahindra 2W (on-going), <b>National Centre for Antarctic Ocean and Research (successfully executed)</b> and many more.</span>

<br>
City of Gwalior located on the extreme north of Madhya Pradesh is named after sage Gwalipa. It is famous as city of iconic composer and singer Tansen and also as city of the Scindia's. Its locational co-ordinates are 26.22º N and 78.18º E. It is located at a driving distance of 127 km south of Agra, and about 320 km south of Delhi. State capital Bhopal is approximately 424 km southwards from Gwalior.<br>
<br>
Gwalior city is renowned for its fort, Palace of the Scindias, Tansen's tomb, institutions and Air Force base. Gwalior has the country's only BSF (Border Security Force) Academy. It also boasts of Lakshmi Bai National University for Physical Education, and R.M.T. Music and Arts University, the only of their kinds in entire India. Of course this city is also home to ABV-IIITM.<br>
<br>
<b>Geography and Climate</b> -&nbsp;&nbsp; The topography of this city is predominantly level except around the fort which is located on a hill top. From this fort you get a panoramic view of the entire city. Summers are hot and dry and last from end March till beginning of monsoon in early July. Rainy season lasts till end September after which winter sets in after a brief autumn in October. Winter lasts from November till February. Summer temperature could be as high as 45º C and winter temperatures could reach 4º C.

<br>
<span><b>Reaching Gwalior</b></span><br>
<br>
Gwalior is accessible by roads, railways and air. Gwalior Junction is among those few stations that is served by both broad gauge and narrow gauge railway lines. This junction station serves as a link to five directions:&nbsp; Agra, Jhansi, Shivpuri, Bhind, and Sheopur Kalan. All except Sheopur Kalan have broad gauge access with Gwalior. Though there are few direct trains connecting this city to Delhi, Chennai, Kolkata, and Mumbai, Gwalior falls en-route on Delhi-Chennai, and Delhi-Mumbai trains.
